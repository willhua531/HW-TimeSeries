## Regression Analysis
### Does this model perform better or worse on out-of-sample data compared to in-sample data?
We got a negative Out-Of-Sample r2, it means that Out-Of-Sample's performance is bad. However, we got a lower Out-Of-Sample RMSE than In-Sample RMSE. If I have to choose which performs better, I would say In-Sample, because at least it has a positive R2.
